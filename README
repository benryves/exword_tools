Exword Tools
==================================================
This is a collection of tools used for communicating with
CASIO Ex-Word dictionaries using the libexword library.

Included applications:
   * TextLoader
   * Library
   * LibraryInstaller


TextLoader
--------------------------------------------------

This application is written to allow uploading and removal
of text files to/from Ex-Word dictionaries. It provides similar
functionality to CASIO's offical TextLoader program.

Library
--------------------------------------------------
This application is an implementation of Casio's CasioLibrary
program. It allows you to install add-ons onto an exword device as
well as removing installed add-ons.

LibraryInstaller
--------------------------------------------------
This application is used to unpack and install add-on dictionaries
onto your local computer which can then be managed by the Library
program. It installs the add-ons into the <AppData>/exword directory.
<AppData> points to the following locations depending on your OS:
	Unix/Linux: ~/.local/share/
	Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<Username>\Application Data\
	Mac OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/

The wizard will also decrypt the unpacked files however on Non-windows
systems wine is required in order to execute the exword_decrypt.exe program.

exword_decrypt.exe must be installed in the <AppData>/exword directory.
