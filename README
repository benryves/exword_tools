==================================================
This is a collection of tools used for communicating with
CASIO Ex-Word dictionaries using the libexword library.

TextLoader
--------------------------------------------------

This application is written to allow uploading and removal
of text files to/from Ex-Word dictionaries. It provides similar
functionality to CASIO's offical TextLoader program.

This application is an implementation of Casio's CasioLibrary
program. It allows you to install add-ons onto an exword device as
well as removing installed add-ons.
